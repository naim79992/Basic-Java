An inner class without a name =Annonimous class
Annonimous class is used to override the method of a class/interface without creating any subclass
Annonimous class is used to declare and instantiate a class at the same time
2 things happend behind the scene:
1. Subclass(Annonimous class) is created, name decided by the compiler
2. An object of the subclass is created and assign its reference to the superclass reference

Key Points ðŸ”¥
No class name â†’ Defined inline.
Used with interfaces, abstract classes, or parent classes.
Good for short, one-time use objects.
Cannot have constructors because they donâ€™t have a name.
ðŸš€ Quick & efficient for small modifications!

Syntax:
```java 
SuperClass obj = new SuperClass() {
    // Overriding methods
};
------------------
Normal class:
class Dog extends Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Woof Woof!");
    }
}
--------------------
Annonimous class:
Animal obj = new Animal() {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Meow Meow!");
    }
};
