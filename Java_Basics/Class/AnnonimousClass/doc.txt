An inner class without a name =Annonimous class
Annonimous class is used to override the method of a class/interface without creating any subclass
Annonimous class is used to declare and instantiate a class at the same time
2 things happend behind the scene:
1. Subclass(Annonimous class) is created, name decided by the compiler
2. An object of the subclass is created and assign its reference to the superclass reference
